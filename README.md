Evaluation of prompting styles and LLMs for fake review detection


## Research Questions: \

•⁠  ⁠Which prompting is more effective for the fake review detection? \
•⁠  ⁠Which prompting styles are effective in which LLMs?\
•⁠  ⁠What is the overlap among multiple models for catch/classification of data\
•⁠  ⁠Prompting LLMs vs Transformer LLMs \
•⁠  ⁠Computation vs performance\
•⁠  ⁠Large models vs basic/mobile models\
•⁠  ⁠Inherent problems, maybe some are only work in extreme cases or can be extremely positive or things they don’t catch\
