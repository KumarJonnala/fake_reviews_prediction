The reviewer mentions that everything was fine for thirty years ago, implying a significant improvement from past experiences, but does not provide any concrete examples or complaints to support this claim. Additionally, the tone of the review seems more focused on expressing enthusiasm than providing criticism or negative feedback, which is another characteristic of deceptive reviews. -> Cleaned: deceptive\n",
