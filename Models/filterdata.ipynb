      "While visiting the Chicago area, we chose the Hotel Monaco Chicago for our stay. As one of the premier luxury hotels in Chicago, we held high expectations but were quickly disappointed in what we recieved. The problems began as soon as we arrived. The attendant was not friendly nor did she have the smile that is suppose to be the symbol of Kimpton. And, when we went to our room only to discover that we had not been given what we had paid for, the situation only got worse. Rather than apologize for the error (my credit card receipt was on hand) we were blamed for the indescrpencies in rooms and told that not only was the room we had reserved and paid for more than two months unavailable, we would not recieve a refund of the price difference of the two rooms. I could not believe that a top 40 U.S. hotel that is suppose to be committed to excellence could make such a blunder! With no choice but to retreat back to our room, we were pleasantly pleased with all of the amenities that we did recieve during our stay.

      "\n",
      "**Reasoning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Personal Touches:** The use of phrases like \"hold high expectations,\" \"blunder,\" and \"no choice but to retreat back\" indicates a personal and emotional tone, typical of human reviews.\n",
      "2. **Sentimental Language:** Direct addressing of the reader's feelings about the hotel experience adds depth and authenticity, which is characteristic of original content.\n",
